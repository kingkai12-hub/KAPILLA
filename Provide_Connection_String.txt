I am unable to automatically detect which region your Supabase project is in (Frankfurt, London, New York, etc.).
Because your internet (or computer) only has IPv4, we MUST use the "Pooler URL" specific to your region.

PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vbgvcaqxbdtwozacwvhl/settings/database
   (Or click: Project Settings -> Database)

2. Scroll down to "Connection String".

3. Click "Node.js".

4. Click "Transaction Mode" (Important: NOT Session Mode).

5. Copy the URL. It should look like this:
   postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

6. Paste that ENTIRE URL into the chat below.

(It will tell me the correct region, e.g., aws-0-eu-west-2, and I can fix the connection instantly).
