My connection test with the new password failed for ALL common regions (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, US, India, Brazil, Singapore).

This usually means one of two things:
1. The **Region** is still incorrect.
2. The **Database Password** update hasn't propagated yet (sometimes takes 1-2 mins).

**Please paste the FULL Connection String again (from the Dashboard), just to be 100% sure.**

1. Go to **Settings > Database**.
2. Scroll to **Connection String** > **Node.js**.
3. **COPY** the entire string.
4. **PASTE** it here.

(It will look like: `postgresql://postgres.vbgvcaqxbdtwozacwvhl:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`)
